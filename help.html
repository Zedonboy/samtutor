<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">How does the Premium Subscription work?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>
	The Premium Subscription boosts your position on the site so will you become more visible to potential students. This is based on your address and the amount of kilometres you have selected to travel.&nbsp;You will also receive statistics that can be viewed on your dashboard under 'Manage my listing'. The Premium Subscription is only useful if you're providing face to face lessons and in an area that may be competitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	<strong>The Premium Subscription is $29 monthly&nbsp;subscription or a $108 yearly subscription.</strong> Both payments are automatically renewed.

<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">How can I make my teaching ad more visible?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>
	The more complete and detailed your ad, the more credibility it will have with students and the higher up it will be on the search results.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
	- The title of your ad must be more than 12 words.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
	- Filling in at least 40 words in the "Teaching" and "Experiences" sections of your ad.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
	- Don't forget to 
	<a href="dashboard.html" target="_blank">validate your cell phone number</a><strong></strong> and <a href="dashboard.html" target="_blank">your email</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
	- 
	<a href="dashboard-profile-diploma.html"> Send us your degree or qualifications certificate</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
	- 
	<a href="dashboard-profile-photo.html"> Upload a clear profile photo to your ad</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
	- 
	<a href="dashboard-profile-recommendations.html">Ask your friends, family and former students to leave you a recommendation</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
	- Add a video to your ad, it's a real plus!
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
	- You also need to be as responsive as possible to the lesson requests you receive. The faster you answer, even if it's to decline the request, the higher your profile will be ranked and the more visible it will be to students.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
	- Have your Superprof students leave reviews on your profile. You can leave a review for your students&nbsp;a week after the lesson has been accepted. When you do, an automatic email is sent, inviting them to do the same.
</p>
<p>
</p>

<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">How do I fix the rates for my tutorials?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>Setting your rates too high can scare the students, while rates that are too low may suggest incompetence. To find the optimal rate:</p>

<p>
</p>


<p>1. Look at how much teachers are asking for in your subject and in your city. (An average rate is suggested when you are creating your ad.)</p>

<p>2. Adjust the rate according to your degree, skills, and experience.</p> 

<p>3. Adjust the rate according to the travel time required and the duration of the class.</p>

<p>4. Re-evaluate your rate based on the number of students who contact you.</p></div></div>
<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">I want to cancel my Premium Subscription. What should I do?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>
If you wish to cancel your subscription to the Premium Subscription, let us know through the following form:
</p>
<p>
	<input type="submit" data-connect-id="signin" data-connect-type="help" name="submit" value="Log-in" class="buttonN connect-modal" />
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, please contact us 5 business days before the automatic renewal date of your subscription so that we can process the request.

</p>
<p>
We hope to have you back in our VIP club very soon!&nbsp;</p></div></div>
<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">How do I create my own teaching ad?</div><div
class="reponse"><p><p align="justify">
	Creating your teaching ad could not be simpler, just follow the step by step instructions on Superprof and fill out each section. Here are a few helpful tips to help make it as visible as possible to potential students, allowing them to find you:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Highlight your Strengths (your skills, your experience...)</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Ask yourself why a potential client may choose you over another peer tutor. Explain what differentiates you and makes your private lessons exceptional. Explain your learning style and teaching methodology.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tell your Story</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Teaching is not just about passing on your knowledge; it is also about building a bond of trust with your students. Showing your human side is very important. Showing that you're an interesting and thoughtful person, willing and capable of listening to others. Mention your hobbies, groups you're part of, your travels, your past work experience, and successes in life.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Focus on the Benefits: What are you Providing to your Future Students?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Try to avoid technical terms difficult to comprehend. Also avoid bland or cliché phrases that do not detail what you will provide. For example, do not just say "I teach maths at all levels and for all abilities", mention the exact levels at which you teach as well as the exact topics (algebra, trigonometry, geometry, calculus, etc.)
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Include a Picture that Makes you Stand Out</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Clear frontal photos of your face are an important way for students and teachers to learn about each other. You will increase the number of contacts you make 10 fold by adding a high quality, profile picture of yourself.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Review your Ad</strong>
</p>
<p>
	An advertisement full of mistakes will not be taken seriously. Re-read your ad with a text editor and make a final review before publishing.
</p></div></div>
<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">What subjects can I teach with Superprof?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>
	<strong>At Superprof, we offer more than 1000 subjects across dozens of categories (sports/academia/hobbies/music/etc.).</strong>You don't necessarily have to be a qualified tutor to be an effective educator. For example, a professional pianist is obviously qualified to give piano lessons, but teaching involves much more than certification. It requires passion; love for your craft, enthusiasm and the ability to foster these attributes in your students. A piano teacher does not necessarily have to be a concert pianist, but they must have good ideas on how to become one and how to master the instrument and the music.
</p>
<p>
	If you want to start tutoring in English, you need to have mastered the language yourself, be fluent or bilingual and able to explain concepts in writing, grammar and accent reduction. You may also be required to teach your students the basics of culture and history of the countries where the language is spoken.
</p></div></div>
<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">Why does Superprof ask tutors to offer their first lesson for free?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>
	If you have not yet achieved the "Star" status on Superprof, we require you to offer your first lesson for free. Even if you do have a review, Superprof recommends that you offer the first class for free because;
</p>
<p>
	<strong>It allows you to make a connection with the student</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The purpose of the first meeting is not to give a class to your pupil, but to get to know and understand what their needs are, set up a lesson plan and a teaching method that will allow your pupil to reach his/her goals.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	<strong>It is a small investment for a greater reward</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Offering one hour of your time for free to a student who may use your services all year and spread the word about your services is an excellent investment.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>It reassures students</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Students will contact you more frequently; it is more engaging for them.
</p></div></div>
<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">What form does the first lesson offered for free need to take?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>	The first lesson offered for free is a chance for you and your student to get to know each other however, it does not have to be a formal lesson unless you and the student agree amongst yourselves to do so.</p>
<p>	The first free lesson could be a discussion about your aims and objectives or your teaching methods for example, or it could be a trial lesson to assess the students' ability.</p>
<p>	Whatever form your free lesson takes, be sure to agree&nbsp;on this with the student beforehand, and make sure they understand what is being offered in this first meeting.</p></div></div>
<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">How do I prepare for a private tutorial?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>
	There are as many ways of organizing a class as there are teachers- not to mention that the organization of the course depends on the needs and objectives of the student.
</p>
<p>
	Here is a tried and tested class structure:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Correct the exercises and review the material from the previous class (5-10 min).</strong>
</p>
<p>
	This is a great way to test your students and make sure that they don't forget the material seen before.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Review the current lesson (15-20 min).</strong>
</p>
<p>
	To know which points are most crucial for the student, it is a good idea to have them review the class. Ask them to describe what they have learnt, what do they mean, and can they expand on less assimilated points.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Practice exercises (20-30 min).</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Understanding a class is good, but knowing how to apply your knowledge as part of a problem, an exercise or in real life, is better. Have your student do as many exercises as possible.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Take stock (5-10 minutes).</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Ask your student to make sure they understand the notions seen during the session.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Assign homework</strong>
</p>
<p>
	So your student does not forget everything from one week to the next, assign some exercises to allow them to review the most important notions as well as those in which they still have some difficulties.
</p></div></div>
<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">How do I receive recommendations and reviews?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>
	<strong>You can receive recommendations by sending recommendation requests via email on your dashboard page.</strong>&nbsp;Recommendations can be made by friends/family and/or ex students; anyone that can provide a character reference for your teaching experience
</p>
<p>
	Reviews can only be left by students who you have accepted through Superprof. Seven days following initial requests, students will see the option to review their tutors on their dashboard under ‘Recent lesson requests’.
</p></div></div>
<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">I am not 100% sure that I meet the needs of a student.....can I still accept their request?</div><div
class="reponse">Students sometimes ask for specific days/times or perhaps specific areas of teaching you’re not fully knowledgeable about when making a request. Even if these types of requests don’t match your own schedule or areas of expertise but you are still available to give lessons, we suggest accepting the request and explaining your own availabilities and limitations. Students can often be very flexible and so it worth keeping the contact open. Once you have refused a request, students can no longer respond. <p></p>

Please note, you are not obligated to start lessons with a student even if you accept a request.</div></div>
<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">How can I give lessons online?</div><div

<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">Who sets the number of hours and the pace of the lessons?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>
	You directly define with the student the agenda that you want to set up. Superprof does not intervene in any way in the organization of lessons or the relationship between tutor and student.

class="reponse"><p>This is a security measure for our tutors that we have put in place so that you are not damaged by the last-minute cancellations of your students.</p><p>You have to choose between the compensation of 0%, 50%, or 100% of the lesson price. You can set this from the Cancellation Policy page.</p></div></div>
<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">First lesson free</div><div
class="reponse"><p>If you do not have a review from a student already on Superprof, we require you to offer your first session for free. This does not have to be a formal lesson, but more a short&nbsp;class&nbsp;reserved for getting to know the student, understanding their aims and objectives and agreeing on a teaching plan that works for both parties. This feature can be removed once you have a review from a Superprof&nbsp;student. Please get in touch with customer service at : hellocanada@superprof.com </p></div></div>
<div
class="Cbloc"><div
class="question">How do I get paid?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>The student will pay you for classes online directly through Paypal. You will receive the payment 24 hours after the scheduled lesson has been completed. Your student will also have the option of choosing to pay for packs of 5 or 10 lessons in advance. If you accept the pack proposition, you will receive 50% of the payment immediately, and the remaining 50% from the moment all lessons have been scheduled and done. Therefore, each lesson from the pack must be scheduled via the platform (ambassador teachers receive 100% at once). Superprof will receive a 10% commission on all classes and packs booked through the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>You also have the option to subscribe to the Premium Pass, which is a monthly subscription of 29$ and offers many benefits including 0% commission.&nbsp;</p>

class="reponse"><p>Make sure you get paid!

<div
class="Cbloc" id="_tutor-listings-692"><div
class="question">How do I create my own teaching ad?</div><div
class="reponse"><p><p align="justify">
	Creating your teaching ad could not be simpler, just follow the step by step instructions on Superprof and fill out each section. Here are a few helpful tips to help make it as visible as possible to potential students, allowing them to find you:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Highlight your Strengths (your skills, your experience...)</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Ask yourself why a potential client may choose you over another peer tutor. Explain what differentiates you and makes your private lessons exceptional. Explain your learning style and teaching methodology.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tell your Story</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Teaching is not just about passing on your knowledge; it is also about building a bond of trust with your students. Showing your human side is very important. Showing that you're an interesting and thoughtful person, willing and capable of listening to others. Mention your hobbies, groups you're part of, your travels, your past work experience, and successes in life.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Focus on the Benefits: What are you Providing to your Future Students?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Try to avoid technical terms difficult to comprehend. Also avoid bland or cliché phrases that do not detail what you will provide. For example, do not just say "I teach maths at all levels and for all abilities", mention the exact levels at which you teach as well as the exact topics (algebra, trigonometry, geometry, calculus, etc.)
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Include a Picture that Makes you Stand Out</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Clear frontal photos of your face are an important way for students and teachers to learn about each other. You will increase the number of contacts you make 10 fold by adding a high quality, profile picture of yourself.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Review your Ad</strong>
</p>
<p>
	An advertisement full of mistakes will not be taken seriously. Re-read your ad with a text editor and make a final review before publishing.

class="question">What subjects can I teach with Superprof?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>
	<strong>At Superprof, we offer more than 1000 subjects across dozens of categories (sports/academia/hobbies/music/etc.).</strong>You don't necessarily have to be a qualified tutor to be an effective educator. For example, a professional pianist is obviously qualified to give piano lessons, but teaching involves much more than certification. It requires passion; love for your craft, enthusiasm and the ability to foster these attributes in your students. A piano teacher does not necessarily have to be a concert pianist, but they must have good ideas on how to become one and how to master the instrument and the music.
</p>
<p>
	If you want to start tutoring in English, you need to have mastered the language yourself, be fluent or bilingual and able to explain concepts in writing, grammar and accent reduction. You may also be required to teach your students the basics of culture and history of the countries where the language is spoken.

class="reponse"><p>
	If you have not yet achieved the "Star" status on Superprof, we require you to offer your first lesson for free. Even if you do have a review, Superprof recommends that you offer the first class for free because;
</p>
<p>
	<strong>It allows you to make a connection with the student</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The purpose of the first meeting is not to give a class to your pupil, but to get to know and understand what their needs are, set up a lesson plan and a teaching method that will allow your pupil to reach his/her goals.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	<strong>It is a small investment for a greater reward</strong>

	Offering one hour of your time for free to a student who may use your services all year and spread the word about your services is an excellent investment.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>It reassures students</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Students will contact you more frequently; it is more engaging for them.

<p>	The first free lesson could be a discussion about your aims and objectives or your teaching methods for example, or it could be a trial lesson to assess the students' ability.</p>
<p>	Whatever form your free lesson takes, be sure to agree&nbsp;on this with the student beforehand, and make sure they understand what is being offered in this first meeting.</p></div><div

<div
class="Cbloc" id="_tutor-management-696"><div
class="question">Why be responsive to lesson requests?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>
	If your tutor listing interests a potential student, Superprof will automatically send you an email/SMS to let you know that a student wants to take a class with you.
</p>
<p>
	Be reactive!
</p>
<p>
	Some students contact several tutors at once to be sure to find a perfect fit. The longer you wait to answer them, the more likely it is that the will find another teacher in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
	The more responsive you are, the more Superprof will improve the visibility of your ad (reactivity is part of Superprof's selection criteria).

class="question">How do I find students for private lessons?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>
	<b style="background-color: initial;"></b><strong>Target your ads</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
	If you give classes in several subjects (i.e. maths &amp; english), create as many ads as you have subject areas. This will allow your classes to be more targeted (only indicate your maths experience in the maths ad ...) and adapt your rates according to the subject taught.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Carry out some testing</strong>
</p>
<p>
	If few students contact you, increase or decrease your rates and/or change the title of your ad and/or profile picture and see what happens.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Talk about yourself</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Share your Superprof ads on social networks, on specialized sites or on classified ads sites. Ask your baker, pharmacist, neighborhood association or your other students if they know someone who is looking for a tutor. The more you talk about yourself, the quicker you'll find students.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Our Pro Pass</strong>
</p>
<p>
	If this is not enough, subscribe to the professional offer. For a fee of $14 per month (or $105 per year), the score of your ad will increase by 100 points, giving your ad more visibility. If you have friends who are looking for someone, do not hesitate to tell them about Superprof and insert a Superprof link on social networks and your personal website. Increasing awareness of the site will bring more prospects to all.

class="question">How do I prepare for a private tutorial?</div><div
class="reponse"><p>
	There are as many ways of organizing a class as there are teachers- not to mention that the organization of the course depends on the needs and objectives of the student.
</p>
<p>
	Here is a tried and tested class structure:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Correct the exercises and review the material from the previous class (5-10 min).</strong>
</p>
<p>
	This is a great way to test your students and make sure that they don't forget the material seen before.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Review the current lesson (15-20 min).</strong>
</p>
<p>
	To know which points are most crucial for the student, it is a good idea to have them review the class. Ask them to describe what they have learnt, what do they mean, and can they expand on less assimilated points.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Practice exercises (20-30 min).</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Understanding a class is good, but knowing how to apply your knowledge as part of a problem, an exercise or in real life, is better. Have your student do as many exercises as possible.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Take stock (5-10 minutes).</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Ask your student to make sure they understand the notions seen during the session.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Assign homework</strong>
</p>
<p>
	So your student does not forget everything from one week to the next, assign some exercises to allow them to review the most important notions as well as those in which they still have some difficulties.

class="reponse">Students sometimes ask for specific days/times or perhaps specific areas of teaching you’re not fully knowledgeable about when making a request. Even if these types of requests don’t match your own schedule or areas of expertise but you are still available to give lessons, we suggest accepting the request and explaining your own availabilities and limitations. Students can often be very flexible and so it worth keeping the contact open. Once you have refused a request, students can no longer respond. <p></p>

<p>
During the booking process, be specific about what you want to learn, your needs, background, level and availability so that the tutor can reply to your request with full knowledge of your conditions. Don’t worry, our tutors only accept lessons that they know they will be able to give.

class="reponse"><p>
	In order to message tutors, you will be asked to pay a monthly subscription&nbsp;of $39, which is not connected with an individual tutor’s rates. The Student Pass is a subscription&nbsp;of $39/ month&nbsp;which allows you to&nbsp;contact as many tutors as you wish. There is no engagement, you can manage and cancel your student pass at any moment through your account settings.&nbsp;</p><p>Your Student Pass is renewed automatically after 30 days. The subscription is non-binding and you can cancel your subscription at any moment via your dashboard or by contacting our Customer Service team.&nbsp;</p><p>If you get an accepted request and later the lesson does not occur, you will be able to get a refund as long as you can show through email/SMS that the lesson did not take place.There is, however, no obligation to start lessons with tutors who accept your requests, so make sure to message a few tutors at once to guarantee a response. Make sure to put as much information in your message as possible.</p></div><div

The student will be notified if the tutor that they have been rematched with is available to give them lessons. If the student agrees to take lessons with the rematched tutor, then the student simply has to select&nbsp;‘Discuss’ from the tutor’s message in the messaging centre from their Superprof dashboard. The student will then be able to contact the tutor in order to begin lessons and by clicking&nbsp;‘Discuss’ and&nbsp;this will automatically trigger the monthly subscription for the student pass.&nbsp; </p></div><div
