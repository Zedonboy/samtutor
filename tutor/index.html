<span

<span
itemprop="text" class="hidden"><p><p align="justify">
	Creating your teaching ad could not be simpler, just follow the step by step instructions on Superprof and fill out each section. Here are a few helpful tips to help make it as visible as possible to potential students, allowing them to find you:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Highlight your Strengths (your skills, your experience...)</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Ask yourself why a potential client may choose you over another peer tutor. Explain what differentiates you and makes your private lessons exceptional. Explain your learning style and teaching methodology.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tell your Story</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Teaching is not just about passing on your knowledge; it is also about building a bond of trust with your students. Showing your human side is very important. Showing that you're an interesting and thoughtful person, willing and capable of listening to others. Mention your hobbies, groups you're part of, your travels, your past work experience, and successes in life.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Focus on the Benefits: What are you Providing to your Future Students?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Try to avoid technical terms difficult to comprehend. Also avoid bland or cliché phrases that do not detail what you will provide. For example, do not just say "I teach maths at all levels and for all abilities", mention the exact levels at which you teach as well as the exact topics (algebra, trigonometry, geometry, calculus, etc.)
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Include a Picture that Makes you Stand Out</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Clear frontal photos of your face are an important way for students and teachers to learn about each other. You will increase the number of contacts you make 10 fold by adding a high quality, profile picture of yourself.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Review your Ad</strong>
</p>
<p>
	An advertisement full of mistakes will not be taken seriously. Re-read your ad with a text editor and make a final review before publishing.

<p>
To ensure that your ad is as visible as possible, we recommend that you take the time to fill in with care all of the different sections of the ad and don't forget to upload a smiling picture of yourself and a certificate of your qualifications. We also recommend that you ask your former students, colleagues or professors&nbsp;for 
	<a href="http://www.superprof.ca/dashboard.html/evaluations/references" target="_blank">recommendations</a>.

	<b style="background-color: initial;"></b><strong>Target your ads</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
	If you give classes in several subjects (i.e. maths &amp; english), create as many ads as you have subject areas. This will allow your classes to be more targeted (only indicate your maths experience in the maths ad ...) and adapt your rates according to the subject taught.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Carry out some testing</strong>
</p>
<p>
	If few students contact you, increase or decrease your rates and/or change the title of your ad and/or profile picture and see what happens.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Talk about yourself</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Share your Superprof ads on social networks, on specialized sites or on classified ads sites. Ask your baker, pharmacist, neighborhood association or your other students if they know someone who is looking for a tutor. The more you talk about yourself, the quicker you'll find students.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Our Pro Pass</strong>
</p>
<p>
	If this is not enough, subscribe to the professional offer. For a fee of $14 per month (or $105 per year), the score of your ad will increase by 100 points, giving your ad more visibility. If you have friends who are looking for someone, do not hesitate to tell them about Superprof and insert a Superprof link on social networks and your personal website. Increasing awareness of the site will bring more prospects to all.

	<strong>At Superprof, we offer more than 1000 subjects across dozens of categories (sports/academia/hobbies/music/etc.).</strong>You don't necessarily have to be a qualified tutor to be an effective educator. For example, a professional pianist is obviously qualified to give piano lessons, but teaching involves much more than certification.

<span
itemprop="text" class="hidden"><p>
	There are as many ways of organizing a class as there are teachers- not to mention that the organization of the course depends on the needs and objectives of the student.
</p>
<p>
	Here is a tried and tested class structure:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Correct the exercises and review the material from the previous class (5-10 min).</strong>
</p>
<p>
	This is a great way to test your students and make sure that they don't forget the material seen before.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Review the current lesson (15-20 min).</strong>
</p>
<p>
	To know which points are most crucial for the student, it is a good idea to have them review the class. Ask them to describe what they have learnt, what do they mean, and can they expand on less assimilated points.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Practice exercises (20-30 min).</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Understanding a class is good, but knowing how to apply your knowledge as part of a problem, an exercise or in real life, is better. Have your student do as many exercises as possible.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Take stock (5-10 minutes).</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Ask your student to make sure they understand the notions seen during the session.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Assign homework</strong>
</p>
<p>
	So your student does not forget everything from one week to the next, assign some exercises to allow them to review the most important notions as well as those in which they still have some difficulties.

If you’re looking to become a tutor, then you've come to the right place! More than 1 million tutors and mentors can already attest to how easy it is to become a private teacher on Superprof and find motivated students from all over the world.

Asking yourself "how do I become a tutor?" or "How should I find tutoring jobs near me?" Well, you've come to the right place. Starting your tutoring job is very simple. In fact, by landing on this page you're already half way there. In just 10 minutes, you can create your online teaching ad on Superprof, advertising lessons locally and via webcam. The only thing we ask is a little goodwill when creating your profile, to give a short description of your past experiences, whether or not you've tutored or taught before, and add a nice, friendly photo of yourself.

<b>Why Become a Tutor?</b>

Everyone has a passion to share or a skill to teach. Tutoring is great for people looking for a flexible schedule, part-time teaching jobs, online teaching jobs, careers after teaching, or to start their own practice or business. 

Superprof is completely free to use for its members, and with over 35,000 daily requests for lessons across our platforms, your ad will get great visibility. Superprof offers everyone the chance to teach, providing everything from online tutoring jobs for students, online tutoring jobs for teachers, VCE and uni level maths tutor jobs, dance teacher jobs, french tutoring jobs, art tutor jobs and 1000's more .

Jack, a Spanish tutor in Melbourne, registered for just 1 month on Superprof. He now has 4 students and gives 24 hours of Spanish lessons a month. His hourly rate is $20 per hour and he earned $480 on top of his income as a Bartender. Learn how to tutor Spanish yourself.

<b> I’m a Student. Can I Become a Tutor?</b>

Students are highly sought-after as tutors. Having recently finished or currently studying your chosen discipline, you have an ideal profile to give peer tutoring or mentoring from home, and homework support for school students.

In addition, students at university or business school often have versatile skill sets that enable them to offer courses to those who need help across a variety of subjects. Whether you’re a physics tutor, Spanish tutor, ESL teacher or biology tutor, everyone is welcome on Superprof.

Tutor jobs are great for students looking for part time teaching jobs or holiday work, summer tutoring jobs, or trying to juggle their studies with active social lives.

James, a pupil at Monash, has taught VCE Economics classes since 2014. Students contact him and he helps them prepare for their exams, essay writing and university entry papers. He has made university preparation his specialty. Each month, these classes bring in more than $800.

<b> I am a School Teacher. Am I Authorised to Tutor Privately as well? </b>

Absolutely! In fact a survey in 2016 showed that nearly half of all state educators have worked in private tutoring as well at some point in their career. To date, more than 300,000 teachers have chosen to use Superprof globally to find private tutoring jobs and offer private lessons. Why not teach in a more relaxed and studious environment as a private tutor or online tutor? No rowdy classrooms to control, no detentions to issue. Get paid a great hourly wage with 1 on 1 lessons and be your own boss!

In Canada there are no laws against offering private lessons while employed as a teacher and many supplement their incomes by offering in home tutoring and online tutoring jobs from home.

It is essential to check the policy of your individual school or tutoring agency however, as some establishments place limits on teachers ability to tutor children from their own class or school. You may want to limit your tutoring to students outside your class or school, even if not directed to do so, to avoid any conflicts of interest such as perceived favouritism that might arise.

It is also important to remember that teaching and tutoring can be quite different and require alternative skills. Tutors require fewer qualifications but may have the passion and desire necessary to be a great one on one tutor.

<b> Jobs for Ex Teachers in Canada Life After Teaching
Want a career change from teaching? Leaving the Teaching discipline is never an easy decision. </b>

But do not fear, there are many jobs for retired teachers, ex teacher jobs, and teachers looking for a new adventure. Why not consider becoming a private tutor or become an online tutor from the comfort of your own home. Tutoring is one of many other jobs for teachers and with Superprof’s guides on how to be a tutor; it has never been easier to search for jobs in education other than teaching.

As a home tutor you may enjoy the freedom to develop your own style and curriculum not permitted within the education system. You could even teach a subject that you’re skilled in, yet not permitted to teach within the sometimes bureaucratic school system! 

<b> I’m an Expert in my Field. Can I Give Private Lessons or Training Sessions? </b>


For experienced musicians, aspiring computer scientists and personal trainers, Superprof’s platform is a great way to meet students, develop your skills, and promote your practice. By creating your tutor or private teacher ad, you’re increasing your visibility across Canada and our sites around the world! Collect testimonials from past and present students and watch your lesson requests sky rocket.

Andres (a PT in Melbourne) received requests from students on the day of his registration. He started teaching a couple afternoons later thus, helping kick start his own personal training business. Becoming a trainer with Superprof helped Andres pass on his passion while increasing his weekly income. Giving lessons at his house also helped limit travel costs.

Whether you're a certified teacher, guitar tutor, writing tutor, algebra tutor, French tutor, chemistry tutor, personal trainer or yoga instructor looking for students, you've come to the right place!

Whatever your profile: advertising via Superprof is entirely free. You set your own hourly rates and pay zero commission to Superprof.

class="landing-teacher-v4-band-how-text"><b> What is Required of Private Tutors in Canada? </b>

As a tutor, teacher or trainer working for yourself there are a number of legal considerations to think about to protect yourself and your students.

It’s important to ensure your income and taxes are up to date and it is a legal requirement to declare your income. Are Superprof involved in payment? No, Superprof are not involved in the payment process between tutors and students: it is for both parties to decide how they want to be paid, whether it's by cash, bank transfer, or through another means.

Insure yourself. It’s not a legal requirement to be insured as a tutor in Canada, but it’s a standard practice to do so. Consider public liability insurance, business and portable equipment insurance and professional indemnity insurance.

Be aware of health and safety. This means providing a safe environment for students to learn. This is very important if you plan to teach from your home.

Advertise honestly. Every claim you make must be factually correct, and you should be able to provide documentary proof of any qualification you claim to hold.

<b> What Subjects Can I Teach? </b>

At Superprof, we offer more than a thousand subjects across dozens of categories (sports/ academia/hobbies/music/etc.). You don’t necessarily have to be a qualified tutor or trainer to be an effective teacher. For example, a professional pianist is obviously qualified to give piano lessons. We are very much of the belief that teaching involves much more than certification. It requires passion; love for your craft, enthusiasm and the ability to foster these attributes in your students. A piano teacher does not necessarily have to be a concert pianist, but they must have good ideas on how to become one and how to master the instrument and the music.

If you want to start tutoring in English, you need to have mastered the language yourself, be fluent or bilingual and able to explain concepts in writing, grammar and accent reduction. You may also be required to teach your students the basics of culture and history of the countries where the language is spoken.

<b>How do I Create my Own Teaching Ad? </b>

Creating your teaching ad could not be simpler, just follow the step by step instructions on Superprof and fill out each section. Here are a few tips to help make your ad as visible as possible to potential students:

Highlight your Strengths (skills, experience...)
Ask yourself why a potential client may choose you over another peer tutor. Explain what differentiates you and makes your private lessons exceptional. Explain your learning style and teaching methodology.

Tell your Story.
Teaching is not just about passing on your knowledge; it is about building a bond of trust with your students. Showing your human side is very important. Showing that you’re an interesting and thoughtful person, willing and capable of listening to others. Mention your hobbies, groups you’re part of, your travels, your past work experience, and successes in life.

Focus on the Benefits: What are you Providing to your Future Students?
Try to avoid technical terms difficult to comprehend. Also avoid bland or cliché phrases that do not detail what your lessons will provide. For example, do not just say “I teach maths at all levels and for all abilities", mention the exact levels at which you teach (UMAT, VCE, QCE, HSC, Gmat, Uni etc.) as well as the exact topics (algebra, trigonometry, geometry, calculus, etc.)

Include a Picture that Makes you Stand Out
Clear frontal photos of your face are an important part of your profile. You will increase the number of contacts you make 10 fold by adding a high quality, profile photo of yourself.

Review your Ad
An advertisement full of mistakes will not be taken seriously. Re-read your ad with a text editor and make a final review before publishing.

<b> Why Should I Offer my First lesson for Free? </b>

If you do not have a review from a student already, Superprof requires you to offer your first session for free, however this does not have to be a formal lesson. 

The first meeting is usually reserved for getting to know each other, understanding the aims and objectives of the student and agreeing on a teaching plan that works for everyone. The first meeting can take the form most convenient for both parties.

Even if you do have a review, Superprof recommends that you offer the first class for free because;

It allows you to make a connection with the student
The purpose of the first meeting is not to give a class to your pupil, but to get to know and understand what their needs are, set up a lesson plan and a teaching method that will allow your pupil to reach his/her goals. 

It is a small investment for a greater reward
Offering one hour of your time for free to a student who may use your services all year and spread the word about your services is an excellent investment.

It reassures students
Students will contact you more frequently and it is more engaging for them.

<b> Why be Responsive to Lesson Requests? </b>

If your tutor listing interests a potential student, Superprof will automatically send you an email/SMS to let you know that a student wants to take a class with you. Please respond quickly to your lesson requests. Even if you are unable to accept a request, let the student know so they can start looking for another tutor that is available.

Be reactive!

Some students contact several tutors at once to be sure to find a perfect fit. The longer you wait to answer them, the more likely it is that the will find another teacher in the meantime...

The more responsive you are, the more Superprof will improve the visibility of your ad (reactivity is part of Superprof's selection criteria).

<b>A Specific Approach to Teaching </b>

The most important aspect of your lesson is to build up the student’s knowledge and confidence within a given subject. Whether you want to teach English, computer science, biochemistry, or piano, it is important to be enthusiastic and encouraging. In a student-teacher relationship, it is essential to implement a "2 way street" where the student feels comfortable to ask questions and challenge themselves.

There is no magic recipe to tutoring. Each tutor has his or her own exercises, syllabus and tips to help the student succeed. Each tutor must put in the time to create an individualized, structured and personalised program for each student. Through this approach, the student can acquire new and reinforce old, methodological skills.</p></div>
