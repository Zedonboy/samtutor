Background</h2><p
class="AnnonceContent_text">
I am a Social Work (Summa Cum Laude/ 1st class) graduate with Clinical Social Work experience.  I have worked in the maternity ward(s) as an Obstetrics, Gynaecology, and Paediatrics Social Work intern for 2 years at New Somerset Hospital. I was volunteering with Crisis of Care (COC) Helpline offering therapeutic services and providing crisis interventions to service users in need, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. In supplementation to that, since July 2020, I have been a Spiritual and Social Support Volunteer Counsellor as part of the Department of Health, Western Cape Government Covid-19 grief, bereavement, and trauma support structure. I am well acquainted with micro, mezzo, and macro therapeutic and developmental interventions. My exposure to and comprehension of Social Work as a subject matter and practice is also amplified by work and projects I have been a part of in education and community setups. The aforementioned entails;  leadership, social responsibility, awareness, social justice campaigns, and social work interventions that, I conducted, facilitated, and implemented as an individual and as a collective. In addition, I have completed an Honours research mini-thesis on Gender-Based Violence (GBV)  with a specific focus on rape in Cape Metropole. I am currently pursuing my 1-year master's program at the University of Calgary, clinical specialization stream with individuals, families, and groups.</p></div>

My personal, professional affiliations and experiences have equipped me with the initiative, passion, competency and commitment necessary to succeed in Social Work as a profession. My lessons intend to assist students with assignments and course work they need further guidance on. I tutor undergraduates- 1st-3rd year Social Work students. My teaching techniques entail visual and practical experiences, cooperative learning and professional development. My methodology is student-centred using approaches of inquiry-based Learning and personalized Learning. Thus far,  I have tutored students from South African, Australian and Canadian institutions.</p></div>

class="questions">
<div
class="bloc_question"><div
class="num">QUESTION 01 | <span
class="max_question">08</span></div><div
class="question">When did you develop an interest in your subject and private tutoring?</div><div
class="reponse"><span
class="prenom">Chipo —</span> To begin with, I am a Social Worker by profession. Social Work is an area of interest of mine and Social Working is a lifelong passion project for me. Subject matters about social phenomena, social justice, mental health as collective, bio-psycho-social wellbeing, social interventions, awareness campaigns and education are important and of key relevance to my purpose. I cannot comment as to when I developed an interest in my subject area. It's something that, I engage in with ease and very much would say it has been reflected in my work ventures, hobbies, conduct and projects I have been a part of and also currently involved in. Therefore, it's definitely a passion pursuit adventure for me. I get a sense of fulfilment and energy from being of service to others.<br />
<br />
Servant leadership is a leadership style I live by and aim to incorporate in my daily endeavours without neglecting the self, "I", giving myself the necessary stewardship, care and kindness I deserve to better care for others. I have also noted that during my undergraduate years, my colleagues would also ask for my assistance with regards to Social Work modules and electives and vice versa. Therefore, I think from that experience, it was the start of something worth trying, as it seemed pleasant, supportive and yet insightful on both ends of the spectrum. As I believe we learn from one another. Thus, I decided to sign up with SuperProf towards the end of my undergraduate degree in 2019 and have been a part of this platform since then.</div>

</div>
<div
class="bloc_question"><div
class="num">QUESTION 02 | <span
class="max_question">08</span></div><div
class="question">Tell us more about the subject you teach, the topics you like to discuss with students (and possibly those you like a little less).</div><div
class="reponse"><span
class="prenom">Chipo —</span> My decision to pursue Social Work as a profession is based on how energized and enthusiastic, I get when presented with the opportunity to better the lives of people. It gives me the joy to be able to leave a mark in the lives of those that feel; less valuable, exploited, marginalized, exposed to degrading social phenomena through either social intervention or social welfare policy transformation. I have committed myself to a purpose I am passionate about and have been able to give back where I can. This also includes; platforms that allow and promote the exchange of knowledge and educating others or vice versa.<br />
<br />
<br />
The subjects/ topics I am interested in teaching are related to the components of what makes a Social Work degree valuable and tangible. This entails Social Work modules; Field Work/ Practicum and Portfolio Development, Ethics and Values, Child, Family, Youth and Community, Wellbeing, Health and Wellbeing, Social Work Research, Social Policy, Social Welfare Law, Case Studies, Social ills, Theories and Models of Intervention and Social Work as a collective at Micro, Mezzo and Macro-level.<br />
<br />
<br />
I majored in Psychology hence, that is an area of interest for me as well, with minoring courses in Anthropology and Sociology (1st & 2nd-year modules). In terms of Psychology, I am well vested in Brain and Behaviour, Study of Human Development, Introduction to Psychopathology, and Psychological Intervention modules. To add on, I have a key understanding of the following; Introduction to Personality Theory, Qualitative Research Methods and Psychology of Social Identity and Oppression. I am not well lettered and interested in the underpinnings of Quantitative Research Methods (Statistics). Nonetheless, my informed experience through theory, practice, and working in a multidisciplinary team, has expanded my knowledge in terms of Primary Health Care and Interdisciplinary Health Promotion which makes up for the topics I am least interested in.</div>

</div>
<div
class="bloc_question"><div
class="num">QUESTION 03 | <span
class="max_question">08</span></div><div
class="question">Did you have any role models? Perhaps a teacher that inspired you?</div><div
class="reponse"><span
class="prenom">Chipo —</span> Oh yes, I really don't go overboard with searching for inspiration. I think charity begins at home. My mother inspires me every single day; her sense of independence, resilience, dedication, being a go-getter, advocacy, sense of service, caring, nurturing spirit, informed disposition, sense of humour, willingness to learn, evolve, wisdom and entrepreneurship ability and adventures are among some of my favourite qualities of her. The list can go on and on with regards to her attributes, my experience of her, detailing, but we will stick to the aforementioned for time sake. I think I would name my mom, a Conqueror, definitely conquerors against all odds. My Rockstar.<br />
<br />
<br />
A teacher who has inspired me, is my primary school science teacher, Mrs Kazadi who taught me at an International School in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Wow! God bless her soul wherever she is. She was really passionate about that subject matter and would go an extra mile for her students. I think to some extent, she made me fall in love with Science (I even got an award for it, ha-ha at some point). Although I didn't follow through in that direction in terms of my career choice, at some point, I fancied being a pharmacist or scientist. Just a dream, but I am glad I engage with it in some sense on an everyday basis-the overall well-being of the human race.<br />
<br />
Mrs Kazadi made class fun, interactive and enjoyable. I couldn't wait to be in science class. I will not forget the home tests and also her honest review of you as a student which was done in an assertive, respectful yet empathetic way, that would not shame or embarrass you, the student, be it in the classroom or privately. Also, she taught me one of my favourite abbreviations MYOB which stands for Mind Your Own Business (but in my case, we (the students) at times would add the W for Wax- beeswax). It has stuck with me to this very day. Very applicable I must say.</div>

</div>
<div
class="bloc_question"><div
class="num">QUESTION 04 | <span
class="max_question">08</span></div><div
class="question">What do you think are the qualities required to be a good tutor?</div><div
class="reponse"><span
class="prenom">Chipo —</span> I think, to begin with, work ethic is the most paramount thing that is important in being or becoming a good tutor. One should be trainable, optimistic (no to toxic positivity), have a willingness to learn as exposure leads to an expansion like Fred Taylor on the "I AM ATHLETE" podcast would say. Also one needs to come up with a leadership style that will announce their conduct and order of business- tutoring.<br />
<br />
<br />
In terms of Leadership for me, the extent of my involvement in the community invokes the age-old question, "are leaders born or made?" Whether they are born or made, greater leaders, if empowered well create a chain reaction of excellence within their influence. I also think to some extent tutors are leaders. John Quincy Adams once said, "If your actions inspire others, To learn more, Do more and Become more, You are a leader". I am of the view that this is also applicable in the tutoring profession or platform making it fun and interactive, influencing students in a positive light in terms of academic concerns. To a greater extent, this is further strengthened by engaging in allied partnerships and the maintenance of professional relationships.<br />
<br />
I believe that to materialize such a leadership characteristic as J.Q. Adams posited that there are classes of strengths that a leader needs to have. An effective leader can display effectiveness in their leadership. To achieve such yields, it then means that, effective leaders define themselves by portraying various characteristics. At the same time, leaders are different and the nuclei of their functionality are different. I have put together Table 1 to aid me in summarizing the qualities that I identify to be hugely associated with a great leader also in being a good tutor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Table 1 Qualities of great & effective leaders<br />
<br />
Melancholic Strengths- Thoughtful, Considerate, Organized, Excessive planner, Schedule oriented, Detailed<br />
<br />
Sanguine Strengths- Charismatic, Sociable, Confident, Warm-hearted, Optimistic, Spontaneous<br />
<br />
Phlegmatic Strengths- Content with themselves, Accepting, Diplomatic, Curious, Observant<br />
<br />
Choleric Strengths- Ambitious, Passionate, Efficient, Practical, Delegator<br />
<br />
Being a Superprof tutor is one I intend to seize wholeheartedly without reservation. I have consistently proven throughout my previous studies and working experience that when presented with a chance, I will strive hard as I can to represent myself best and reward those who have granted me a chance to prove such. This is evident in continuing relations with my alma mater, the University of the Western Cape (UWC), and my professional mentors at UWC and globally. Despite my own set of hardships and setbacks, I have always done what is necessary to further my studies and work experience. Perseverance, Open-Mindedness, Discipline, Dedication and Insight to the subject matter and academic goals of students are key instrumentals to being a Superprof.</div>

</div>
<div
class="bloc_question"><div
class="num">QUESTION 05 | <span
class="max_question">08</span></div><div
class="question">Share an anecdote related to your subject or your school days.</div><div
class="reponse"><span
class="prenom">Chipo —</span> This question got me crinkling, quite too many but will share one. It was undergrad, 3rd year, our fieldwork lecturer and coordinator decided, it would be a great idea to conduct interviews with us his students. So as to have a better understanding of us individually and also indicate places we would like to conduct our practicum. Beforehand, he made us complete a Curriculum Vitae document, which we had to email back to him, the day before our interview sessions. So interview day comes along, I get in for my session, we exchange greetings, I take my seat like a pro, thinking I had mastered what I had written in my CV and proofread. We go through a set of questions about myself, aspirations, identity etc... and here I am thinking we are making meaningful progress right? Only to have my lecturer ask me, what crime have I committed? I am like what? Excuse me? Chipo was awestricken, shook, baffled and my lecturer says to me, you ticked yes for having a criminal record. Child, I was wowed! I started reminiscing about the kind of life I would have had in jail. What crime could I have possibly committed?<br />
<br />
<br />
In a twinkle of an eye, I literally, saw my life flash before my eyes. I had a deep thinking moment and came back to mother nature in a few. I later then went on to indicate, I had no criminal record and that was a mistake. My lecturer then expatiated on how such mistakes can be detrimental and I should be conscientious. Such a careless mistake I would say, imagine, definitely learnt to double, triple-check my work. They say, "Check yourself before you wreck yourself". Nonetheless, that was a good one, taught me something about not rushing through life and giving my writeups a careful and thorough read. That was an impetuous mistake and pricey. Whew Chile, thank God it was a student/ lecturer interview. Embarrassed but yet embraced that learning moment.</div>

</div>
<div
class="bloc_question"><div
class="num">QUESTION 06 | <span
class="max_question">08</span></div><div
class="question">What were the difficulties or challenges you faced or are still facing at school?</div><div
class="reponse"><span
class="prenom">Chipo —</span> My ambitions to change the lives of other people indiscriminately are so intimate because I have faced my fair share of obstacles. My situation is such that my widowed mother raised me. Reflexively, this translates to the evidence that my growing-up process was not all rosy. She is someone who has always subscribed to the importance of educating the girl child in this 21st century. However, her eagerness to secure the best education for me meant an increase in her financial obligations. It did not take time for me to come to terms with the circumstance that I needed to aid her in my own little way in taking care of me. I pushed my efforts even harder to expose myself to scholarships as availed by the University of Western Cape (UWC). My initial performance in my enrolment year, 2015, ensured that I secured the UWC Merit Bursary.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the coming years, I kept up with the UWC Merit Bursary Award's requirements as I recorded a significant number of distinctions per year. My academic performance was that I grew to become a top-five-percentile student. In acknowledgement of such academic excellence, I received the Golden Key (GK) International Society Scholarship Award. On the New Members Recognition Ceremony, GK awarded me with the New Member Golden Key Chapter Ceremony Award/Scholarship. My source of pride in my academic work was that I displayed competitive results consecutively each year. Upon my graduation in 2019, UWC awarded me a degree in Social Work-Summa Cum Laude! I was the top student in my class. All those aforementioned accolades are a testament to how my academic prowess responded to socio-economic issues in my world.<br />
<br />
<br />
To a greater extent, I would like to commend anyone who has studied or studying Social Work because whew Chile, it requires work and there is always something to submit and complete. Of course, you need to study and work for a degree or anything substantial, Social Work, on the other hand, is its own universe, with demands and requirements extremely vital for the growth, experience, development of the student through reflexivity and reflectivity. Talk about the workload, practicum, fieldwork portfolio, It's not for the fainthearted, to be honest. You need to be passionate about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I get it, you are dealing with the lives of people, so you have to put in the work as required and careless mistakes are not acceptable. I still remember my class going nuts asking for extensions for submissions. We couldn't cope at times, maybe most of the times but we made it work. To our Class Representatives, I Salut you for advocating for us. The class of 2019 was known for extension requests I must say. I have no shame in that. At the end of the quality work is required. That can only be produced through thorough research, mind, soul, spirit balance and rest. Because nothing is funny about being burnout and or experiencing compassion fatigue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finding a balance between my academics and social life during my university days was a struggle as academics came first and were very demanding of my time and energy, but I made it work. Through and through thoroughly, trying my best I guess. Also, having a support system is key. God pulled me through. I also signed myself in for counselling at the Center for Student Support Services (CSSS) when I could not cope in my final year, having skyrocketing panic attacks about a module that was giving me a hard time and my future after graduation. An end of a journey is a beginning of a new one. It's okay to get help. No shame in that, there is only one you at the end of the day. They say "if you don't pick a day for your body to rest, it will do that for you".</div>

class="question">Do you have a particular passion? Is it teaching in general, an element of this particular subject, or something completely different?</div><div
class="reponse"><span
class="prenom">Chipo —</span> I saw a prayer once and it changed my life forever since. Up to now, I still fail to recall the actual words I said to that bereaved woman. It so happened that upon concluding my psychosocial counselling session with her, she said, "thank you". Somehow, I had been able to show her that, despite the loss of her unborn child, she could still lead a fulfilling life. What caught me were not the two words she spoke. Grief limited her vocabulary. What caught me was the prayer I saw in her eyes. My translation of what I saw in her eyes was how she was urging me to keep going and do more. This was in 2018 when I was an Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Paediatrics Social Work intern at New Somerset Hospital (NSH). That prayer in her eyes was almost as physical to the extent that I grabbed it in my hands and fuelled my ambitions. Perhaps that is the reason why I am proud and passionate about Clinical Social Work Practice. My yearning to work within a social and health care setting and aspiration to make a difference, linking theory to practice, by providing essential services has brought me here to continue the journey of social working and educating.<br />
<br />
<br />
Reflectively, I am the product of the choices I make as an adult - absolute entitlement! Nonetheless, my past and my environment as examples of my culture forged the greater part of me. The Southern African socio-construct is such that the society, not the parents alone, raise the child. This has proven to be significant in my identity as an African because the societal patronage of Ubuntu raised me. Ubuntu, which loosely translates to, "I am because we are", is incontrovertible African teaching that emphasizes servitude to others. It then meant that from a tender age, my decorum was forged in the understanding that I needed to serve others for me to live a fulfilling life to some extent. Yet, keeping in mind, the significance of living and extending within my limits and self-care as ultimate stewardship for thyself. I still do not know whether I am a product of my environment or a product of the choices that I make. Nevertheless, the environment I grew up in turned me into a complaisant individual who answers every call to help humanity when I am fortunate to.<br />
<br />
<br />
Armed with Ubuntu, I wanted to do more, reach further, perhaps be an answered prayer in someone's life. That whimsical urge to be that small difference in the eyes of the hopeless drove my decision to become a Social Worker. My undergraduate studies at the University of Western Cape (UWC) exposed me to a plethora of avenues that still need attention to help humanity. Ubuntu instructed me to help others, studying Social Work showed me the result-driven way. I am a young Social Worker who holds education, leadership development and community work at heart. Social Work as a career path for me, allows me to better the lives of people through partnership even if it is one person at a time. I know I can make a difference, through exposure and continued enhancement of social cohesion on a broader scope in my country of residence and globally even if it is one person at a time, as I believe in leading from where you are. The cliental population I would like to further learn to professionally address through continued Social Work education and fieldwork practice entails Child and Family in retrospect of allied/ communal health and social care.</div>

<div
class="bloc_question"><div
class="num">QUESTION 08 | <span
class="max_question">08</span></div><div
class="question">What makes you a Superprof?</div><div
class="reponse"><span
class="prenom">Chipo —</span> Education is a powerful component, which contributes extensively to sustainable human development indices. The acquisition of knowledge and exchange thereof between a tutor and students positions me at significant places where I can contribute to social development. Through Social Work, I can mediate the process of development by enabling individuals and society to reach out to each other through a mutual need for self-fulfilment. Thus, equipped with education, I will be mandated to mobilise and deliver a wide range of services to my clientele and students.<br />
<br />
<br />
Leveraged on education, I will be able to assist in restoring, maintaining, and enhancing the social functioning of individuals and society. This responsibility entails the development, procurement, and/or delivery of resources and services to meet the many and varied needs of my clients and students. In this sense, Social Work plays a significant role in national development through the empowerment of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups of people in the world. Collectively together through academic partnership, leadership and learnership, the students and I can make the world a better place through informed practice and action.<br />
<br />
<br />
Service to others is something that I hold dear to my heart, as I have been involved in servitude since my high school education. Although I would have loved to have done more so far, I think I have just begun to uncover how much difference an individual can make when given the correct platform. I am fully convinced that one can make a difference through effecting and broadening acquired skills by being of service to others. I am a qualified Social Worker who holds education, leadership development as well as community work at heart. In fact, my ultimate career objective is to sentient, a fulfilled life through high personnel standard of servant leadership by serving others and to thrive whilst doing so, philanthropically work to enhance human functioning and social diversity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Such a chosen career path is enough of a testament to depict how Social Work allows me to better the lives of people through partnership even if it is one person at a time. I believe in "leading from where you are" hence, I know I can make a difference through exposure and continued enhancement of social cohesion on a broader scope wherever I am and on whatever platform afforded to me. Perhaps not by just being any Social Worker but an active, result-driven Social Worker. Thus, giving the students what they need, i.e. requested assistance but also affording them, the time and space to exercise independence and informed learning.<br />
<br />
<br />
My soft skills are such that I have excellent communication skills. In addition to that, I have competitive project management and risk assessment skills. These are examples of how I have prepared myself for my full-time career goal. These soft skills are not enough, citing how the problems have grown more complex. Determination alone cannot match the arising societal issues in society. To assist the community, I need to acquire relevant skills hence further my education and exposure to utilising innovative technology and services. I believe by being a Superprof, I am placing myself in a boat that allows me to sail with the trends of this progressive and ever-evolving world.<br />
<br />
<br />
To succeed, one needs to be driven by correct principles and values in which I believe I embody; honesty, integrity, acceptance, diligence, sincerity, objectivity, accountability, responsibility and a call to service. The aforementioned, I believe, makes me a Superprof. Conclusively, I strongly believe, this aspect of my career will assist me in materializing my ambitions. The extent to which Superprof reaches concerning, being of service to others through education/ educating, skill development and assisting students in maintaining academic excellence humbles me. I am also compelled to believe that I can put to good use this opportunity. I would like to end by citing Maya Angelou, a favourite poet of mine, I quote, "Love life, engage in it, give it all you have got. Love it with a passion, because life truly does give back, many times over, what you put into it." I hope I continue to live by these words!</div>
